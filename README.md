# Dice Rolling Game 🎲

## Final Project for Programming 1 
It is a Python-based dice rolling game where the player rolls a virtual dice
to earn points. The game demonstrates the use of variables, user input,
loops, conditional statements, and random number generation.


## Installation
1. Ensure Python 3.6 or higher is installed on your system.  
2. You can download it from here: https://www.python.org/downloads/
3. If you encounter issues with character display, ensure your terminal supports UTF-8 encoding.

This program does not require any external libraries. All required modules
are included with Python by default.

## How the Game Works
When the program starts, the player is asked to enter their name. The player
can then choose to roll a six-sided dice or quit the game. Each roll adds
points to the player’s total score. The game continues until the player
reaches 20 points or decides to quit.

## How to Play
1. Run the program using `python main.py`
2. Enter your name when prompted
3. Type `r` to roll the dice
4. Your score increases with each roll
5. Reach 20 points to win or type `q` to quit
6. Choose whether to play again
