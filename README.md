Dice Rolling Game

Description

This is a Python-based dice rolling game created as a final project for
Programming 1. The game asks the player for their name and allows them to
roll a virtual dice to earn points.

How the Game Works?

When the program starts, the player enters their name. The player can choose
to roll a six-sided dice or quit the game. Each roll adds points to the
player's total score. The game continues until the player reaches 20 points
or decides to quit.

How to Play?

1. Run the program using `python main.py`
2. Enter your name when prompted
3. Type `r` to roll the dice
4. Points are added to your score after each roll
5. Reach 20 points to win or type `q` to quit
6. Choose whether to play again
